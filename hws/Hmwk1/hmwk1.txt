Assignment 1  Total: 8 pts Due: June 1st 11:55pm via Sakai


Week 1
1. (0.5 pts) Translate the following code line-by-line.  What does it do?

 #include <iostream>              // Pre-processor directive

 int main()
 {
    int rows, columns;          // Declare integer members

    char theChar;               // Declare char members

    cout << "How many rows? ";  // Prints to screen string in quotes

    cin >> rows;                // Allows for user input to set value of rows

    cout << "How many columns? "; // Prints to screen string in quotes

    cin >> columns;             // Allows for user input to set value of columns

    cout << "What character? "; // Prints to screen string in quotes

    cin >> theChar;             // Allows for user input to set value of columns

    for (int i = 0; i<rows; i++) // Begin outer

    {

        for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++) // Begin inner

            cout << theChar;      // Print theChar foreach column & row

        cout << "\n";             // Newline after each character

    }
     return 0;                    // End main function
 }

2. (0.5 pts)What is the Big-O notation of the following function:

bool ContainsDuplicates(String[] strings)
{
     for(int  n= 0; n < strings.Length; n++)   // Go through array once O(n)
     {
          for(int m = 0; m < strings.Length; m++)    // For each element in the
          {                                          // array, go through it again
               if(n == m) // Don't compare with self // n*n -> O(n^2)
               {
                    continue;                        // O(1)
               }

               if(strings[n] == strings[m])
               {
                    return true;                     // O(1)
               }
          }
     }
     return false;                                   // can only be reached once
}         // Therefore n * n * 1 * 1 ---> Big O Notation for this func is O(n^2)

3. (1pts total,0.1 each) Multiple Choice Question from the Book for Chapter 1, Questions 1-10
  Multiple choice answers
  1. The basic unit of information is the (b) bit.
  2. The order of an algorithm that finds whether a given Boolean function of n
      variables produces an output of 1 is (d) exponential.
  3. Software engineering primarily deals with (c) reliable and cost-effective
      software.
  4. A pictoreal representation of an algorithm is called (a) a flowchart.
  5. An English-like representation of the code is called (c) a pseudocode.
  6. A Subalgorithm is lso known as a (d) all of the above.
  7. A basic algorithm that arranges data according to their values is known as
       (b) sorting.
  8. Defining the user's needs, requirements, and methods is a part of the
      (a) analysis phase.
  9. In the system development process, and the flowchart is a tool used in the
      (b) design phase.
  10. In the system development process, a pseudocode is a tool used ithe
      (b) design phase.

4. (3pts total) The class Cube has been defined as follows:

class Cube {
     private:
          int length;
          int width;
          int depth;
     public:
          Cube(int l, int w, int d);     // set values of three class
                                    // variables and checks that the
                                    // values are positive integers
          int get_length();         // return length of cube
          int get_width();               // return width of cube
          int get_depth();               // return depth of cube
          int get_area();           // length x width x depth
          int get_surface_area();   // sum of area of all six sides
};

Write the source code for the six public functions. Each function is worth 0.5pts. Donâ€™t forget to include some comments!

Week 2
** 3 pts total for this part **  // Later changed to extra credit

1. (1 pts) Ask user how many cubes he/she wants to make and put them in an Array.
   a. Ask the user how many cubes they would like to create.
   b. Ask use to enter the length,width, and name of each cube
   c. Display the information that the user entered plus their depth and area
2. (1pts) Iterate through the array of cubes and modify there length and width with a random number generator that doesn't make their sizes no bigger than 40.
3. (0.5pts) Display their updated information after the for loop
4. (0.5pts) Delete objects correctly
