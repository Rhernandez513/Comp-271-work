Assignment 1  Total: 8 pts Due: June 1st 11:55pm via Sakai


Week 1
1. (0.5 pts) Translate the following code line-by-line.  What does it do?

 #include <iostream>

 int main()
 {
    int rows, columns;
    
    char theChar;
    
    cout << "How many rows? ";
    
    cin >> rows;
    
    cout << "How many columns? ";
    
    cin >> columns;
    
    cout << "What character? ";
    
    cin >> theChar;
    
    for (int i = 0; i<rows; i++)
        
    {
        
        for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++)
            
            cout << theChar;
        
        cout << "\n";
        
    }
     return 0;
 } 

2. (0.5 pts)What is the Big-O notation of the following function:

bool ContainsDuplicates(String[] strings)
{
     for(int  n= 0; n < strings.Length; n++)
     {
          for(int m = 0; m < strings.Length; m++)
          {
               if(n == m) // Don't compare with self
               {
                    continue;
               }

               if(strings[n] == strings[m])
               {
                    return true;
               }
          }
     }
     return false;
}

3. (1pts total,0.1 each) Multiple Choice Question from the Book for Chapter 1, Questions 1-10 
4. (3pts total) The class Cube has been defined as follows:
 
class Cube {
     private:
          int length;
          int width;
          int depth;
     public:
          Cube(int l, int w, int d);     // set values of three class
                                    // variables and checks that the
                                    // values are positive integers
          int get_length();         // return length of cube
          int get_width();               // return width of cube
          int get_depth();               // return depth of cube
          int get_area();           // length x width x depth
          int get_surface_area();   // sum of area of all six sides
};
 
Write the source code for the six public functions. Each function is worth 0.5pts. Donâ€™t forget to include some comments!

Week 2 (continuation of HW1 will be put up by Monday May 25, 2015)
